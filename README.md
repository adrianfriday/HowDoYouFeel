# HowDoYouFeel

A little song about IoT, and virtual coaching toward wellbeing and sustainability.

    Even more plain language articulation to the nation from our preoccupation
    we're putting up a dime 
    to test a paradigm
    that is exciting and fresh 
    by far will be the best

    this ain't a show down
    or another go round
    with persuasion
    of the nation

    to sit up or step down
    cut fat and walk around 

    we are not talking about just habits
    not a replacement for real practice

    getting reps
    we're gonna aid you
    find a lifestyle that will save you

    we are the new kids on this old block 
    with lots of partners whose reach just doesn't stop

    on the doorstep 
    in the workplace
    round the corner 
    but not in your face
    we're backing way up 
    and saying "you lead"
    we're using sensors 
    and stuff that you need
    to get a picture of your micro climate
    helping tune it 
    where you define it.

    there ain't no app for that no there ain't no app for that
    you're not an app stat you are so much more dan dat. dan dat dan the data than the data 
    you got a life

    you go an live it - make it better with some iot init
    for awhile to make you smile
    enchanted objects not just in your pockets
    in your environment around your internet
    we got your back. 
    with some intelligent
    infrastructure
    and skills for your departure
    from past dependence on 

    the labels on the box
    ya the labels on the box

    forget that - you got a brain = we'll help you use it
    you got choice - so don't refuse it.

    we got your back
    we got your back
    we're coming back
    with some enchanted things so when the door bell rings
    we'll be bringing in
    and you'll be into it
 
    how are you feeling, we are just reeling cuz we're
    all better now
    ya we're better now
    we're better now

    intelligent
    internet 
    infrastructure 
    of 
    them things
